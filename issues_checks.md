Issues:
[x] bank is established for account and upload section, we only need it in one spot
[x] balances dont update on account page for each account
[x] trying to sort category leads to a crash
[x] Smart Auto-cateogization should be hidden until enabled
[x] Remove debug current categories
[x] uncategorized transactions still show even if category assigned
[] when bulk categorizing the number shows only the count on the current page, the notification shows the true number.
[] Once some transactions are cat the page does not populate with more
[] the View All button just loads the paginated thing, instead we should have the total transactions ...
[] bulk edit dialog popup only accounts for transactions on the page, rather than all transactions
[] after accepting bulk edit, changes arent immediately reflected (only the selected one disappears, if theres other transactions of the same type)
[] Uncat menu, category selection should be alphebatizes
[x] old databases are removed when 
[] set rule by specific account
[] auto categorization stats are weird when nothing has been run
[] multiple uploads needs work
[x] When we apply to all similar transactions on the Uncategorized Transactions section, rather than refreshing the page, can we just update on page?
[] Account type is spelled as "Checking" not "Chequing".
[] Change Credit Card account type as default

Checks:
[x] Amex populates right
[] Monthly spending populates right
[] when I set a category and bulk apply it, the next time I add it does it remember?
[] does the app learn from when im applying the categories


To Do:
[x] Merchant names should be stored 
[x] Custom rules for categories
[~] Auto categorys?
[x] database backups 
[x] database save / load
[x] database reset should ask user to confirm before reset
[x] database restore deletes the backup
[x] subcategories?
[] logs / crash reports
[x] add scotiabank
[x] update defaults category
[] help docs for uploading
[] reorg settings page
[] top 3 of category selection should be most common categories
[] insights > add average daily spend, weekly, monthly
[x] multiple uploads allowed?

[] add cibc, rbc, bmo, mbna
