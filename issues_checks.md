Issues:
[] bank is established for account and upload section, we only need it in one spot
[] balances dont update on account page for each account
[] trying to sort category leads to a crash
[] Smart Auto-cateogization should be hidden until enabled
[] Remove debug current categories
[] uncategorized transactions still show even if category assigned
[] when bulk categorizing the number shows only the count on the current page, the notification shows the true number.

Checks:
[] Amex populates right
[] Monthly spending populates right


To Do:
[] Merchant names should be stored 
[] Custom rules for categories
[] Auto categorys?
[] database backups 
[] database save / load
[] database reset should ask user to confirm before reset
[] subcategories?
